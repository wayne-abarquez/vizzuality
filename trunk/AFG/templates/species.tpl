				<p>Nacella concinna is the largest Antarctic intertidal invertebrate and is very abundant, sometimes with up to 100 individuals per square metre. Individuals are very mobile and do not return to a home base. There are two populations of Nacella concinna, which can be distinguished by shell shape, however they do not appear to be genetically distinct, so are not considered to be two subspecies. The shells of individuals of the littoral population are robust and heavy to withstand predation and sea-ice scouring, while the sublittoral morph (living permanently below 4m) has a flatter, thin and lightweight shell. In winter the littoral population migrates downwards to avoid scouring by sea ice, and mixes with the sublittoral population, while in summer they are separate and form two distinct groups. Nacella concinna is well adapted to its nearshore coldwater environment, as in addition to seasonal migration it has the ability to surround itself in a cocoon of highly viscous mucus which enables it to withstand temperatures of -20oC for up to 2 hours, if trapped in ice.</p>

      <h2>What, When and Where are key in biodiversity. Visualizing these three components in Rich Geographic Information applications is what we do best.</h2>
      <p class="sectText">The emergence of Google Maps has allowed for a new level of mapping applications on the web. We love mashups on top of these new maps APIs. Together with the use of spatial standards such as the Open Geospatial Standards, we can build engaging maps experiences that invite users to explore your data while interoperating with external sources through WMS, WFS, etc.
  <br /><br />
  We work on displaying millions of primary data occurrences, creating heat maps and dynamically grouping data. Through innovative use of pyramid gridding techniques we have successfully enabled to play interactive maps for variable resolution for hundreds of millions of point data.</p>

            <p class="featuredDescription">With the new Maps for Flash API that Google released there are great new opportunities for displaying interactive data over Google Maps due to the Flash platform. You can see our <a href="http://biodiversityatlas.com.s3.amazonaws.com/heatMap/heatMap.html">dynamically created HeatMaps from GBIF data</a>. Other example where we had the possibility to tried was combining the World Database on Protected Areas with information from Wikipedia, Flickr and Panoramio. Check out the <a href="http://widgets.gbif.org/country/CountryProtectedAreasWidget.html?iso_code=TZ&country=Tanzania">protected area explorer for Tanzania.</a></p>

    <h2 id="shortdescription">Yes, we like beautiful data visualization, but we do not forget its main purposes: communicate and inspire </h2>
      <h3 id="moredescription">Biodiversity informatics is producing huge amounts of data every day. Unfortunately most of this data is useless withouth effective ways to analyze it. To convey ideas eficiely, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicatiing its key-aspects in a more intuitive way.<br /><br />
Our expertise in data visualization for biodiversity includes: observation data, taxonomic trees, interactive keys, temporal datasets and many more. <a href="/contact/" class="textlink" rel="self">Contact us</a> to check if we can help you with your speciÔ¨Åc use case!</h3>

          <p class="littleText">The Global Biodiversity Information Facility has a very feature rich portal to access biodiversity primary data. Right now this portal is serving more than 160 million occurrences of more than 1.5 million different taxon. We got the challenge to convert this into an Iphone web application to analyze the feasibility of Iphone UI paradigms to browsing taxonomies. In 3 days we came to the following video and an unofficial Iphone version of the GBIF portal.</p>

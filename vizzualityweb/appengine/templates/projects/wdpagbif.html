<p class="titleWork">WDPA-GBIF</p>
<p class="clientName">GBIF</p>
<p class="description"><span class="title">Challengue</span>

	GBIF wanted to integrate their data with the World Database on Protected Areas from UNEP-WCMC. GBIF on the other hand handles massive amounts of primary data collected from lot of different providers. <br><br>The project had to achieve a way to intersect more than 130 Million records from GBIF with 150.000 areas from WDPA.
<br><br>
	Providing a good tool to the users in a clean and easy way was the main goal. Additionally the intersection between all this data could become a big issue with several days of complicated processing.


</p>
 <p class="description"><span class="title">Solution</span>
	
	The project started only focusing on Spain and Madagascar and when the solutions were proven it was scaled to all countries and protected areas. We tried using 2 different strategies for the processing: relational databases for the short term and Map/Reduce strategy for the long term. Relational database, like PostGIS handles the work but were limited in scalability taking up to 17 hours to process the data. Map/Reduce, with Hadoop, was able to do the job much quicker paralyzing the problem in Amazon EC2.
<br><br>
	The widget can be embeded on multiple websites interested only on a certain country, particular area, etc. The user can then download the data if necessary.

</p>
 <p class="description"><span class="title">Highlights &amp; technologies</span>

	The project is a great demonstration of the joint projects that GBIF and WCMC can handle together. The Protected Areas provide context to the Biodiversity data from GBIF and the other way around.  
<br><br>
	A mix of technologies and APIs were used. PostGIS, Java, AMF, Hadoop, Flex, Google Maps, Geoserver, Geowebcache..
